### Give a proper name to tables
Sometimes it's worth to add special suffixes and prefixes like 

`T_NAME_V`, `T_NAME_E`, etc..

to distinguish service and business tables.

### Consider having common columns

|  name             |  type            |  explanation              |
|:------------------|:-----------------|:--------------------------|
|id                 | int              | an artificial integer id |
|version            | int              | increments after each change
|[key/business key] | a set of columns | business key, this values are unique and not null |
|[other data]       | a set of columns | any other data | 
|created_at         | timestamp        | date and time when the row was created |
|modified_at        | timestamp        | date and time when the row was updated last time |
|comment            | string           | any comment, why this row is created or updated. (i.e. put jira ticket number) |

### Constraints 
It's kind a holy war, somebody thinks that everything should be in code.

Give names to all constraints, i.e.

`CONSTRAINT pk_<column_name> PRIMARY KEY (column_name)`

`CONSTRAINT fk_<column_name>  FOREIGN KEY (column_name)`

`CONSTRAINT uq_<column_name> UNIQUE (column_name)`

`CONSTRAINT ck_<column_name> CHECK (column_name > 0)`

`CONSTRAINT idx_<column_name> INDEX (column_name)`

Keep enum as constraints

### Use incremental DB changes 
Consider using tools like LiquidBase or flyway.
