### Talks

#### Introduction to Apache Ignite ML

Apache Ignite is a distributed in-memory data grid. Apache Ignite Machine Learning (ML) is a set of simple, scalable and efficient tools that allow building predictive machine learning models without costly data transfers. In this presentation we are going to get know Apache Ignite better, look at ML library features and nuances of implementing ML algorithms over distributed data. If you are interested in what can be done if data does not fit into one computerÃ¢s memory; you definitely should check out the presentation.
